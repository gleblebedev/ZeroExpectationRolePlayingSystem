# Zero Expectation Role Playing System
Role playing system based on normal (Gaussian) distribution with zero mean (zero expectation) and unit sigma.

The simplest case of a normal distribution is known as the standard normal distribution. This is a special case when {\displaystyle \mu =0}\mu =0 and {\displaystyle \sigma =1}\sigma =1, and it is described by this probability density function:
